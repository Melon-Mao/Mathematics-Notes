# Calculus I

This will contain my notes for Calculus I. I will mainly be using the Calculus I notes by Paul Dawkins, found on [Lamar University's website](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx). There, Dawkins has the notes for quite a few of the courses he teaches, as well as practice problems and useful resources. The expected prerequisite knowledge for Calculus I is a good understanding of algebra and trigonometry, as well as a basic understanding of functions and graphs, though some of this will be covered in the review section.

The main purpose of these notes is not for me to learn the contents of Calculus I. I am familiar with it all, either via school or by me learning the topics by myself. These notes are created with LaTeX, thus helping me learn how to use the software (very important). As a conseuqence, my notes for this are not likely to be completed, but all of the information is already condensed by Dawkin, whose exposition is rather good.

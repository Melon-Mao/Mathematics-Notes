# Calculus I

This will contain my notes for Calculus I, which is a course commonly taken by students in their first year of university. The course is usually split into two semesters, with the first semester covering limits, derivatives, and applications of derivatives, and the second semester covering integrals and applications of integrals. I will mainly be using the Calculus I notes by Paul Dawkins, found on [Lamar University's website](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx). There, Dawkins has the notes for quite a few of the courses he teaches, as well as practice problems and useful resources. The expected prerequisite knowledge for Calculus I is a good understanding of algebra and trigonometry, as well as a basic understanding of functions and graphs, though some of this will be covered in the review section. The preferred flow of the course is as follows:

Review -> Limits -> Derivatives -> Applications of Derivatives -> Integrals -> Applications of Integrals
